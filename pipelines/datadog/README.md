# Datadog Pipeline Documentation

This directory contains the configuration and documentation for integrating Datadog into the observability demo project. The Datadog pipeline is designed to handle both logs and metrics generated by the applications and agents in this project.

## Overview

Datadog is a monitoring and analytics platform that provides observability across applications, infrastructure, and logs. This pipeline allows you to collect, visualize, and analyze logs and metrics from the various applications and agents included in this demo.

## Configuration

The configuration files for the Datadog pipeline are located in this directory. Ensure that you have the necessary Datadog API keys and configurations set up in your environment.

## Usage

To use the Datadog pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Ensure that your environment variables are set correctly, including your Datadog API key.

2. **Run the Pipeline**: Use the provided Docker Compose file in the `deploy` directory to start the services. This will include the Datadog agent configured to collect logs and metrics.

3. **Monitor in Datadog**: Once the services are running, you can monitor the logs and metrics in your Datadog dashboard.
